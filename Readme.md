FIRST FOOD VISUALIZATIONS
Challenge Description:
Geographies with no baby-friendly hospitals, no lactation services, no lactation consultants and no peer support groups have been called “first food deserts” because they create a climate of poor support for breastfeeding where it is extremely unlikely that breastfeeding will be successful.
How can we best visualize those first food deserts at national scale so that we can direct resources and support to the communities most in need?  What are the implications for required investment?
Are there correlations that would provide more support for the benefits of breastfeeding- for example the relationship to educational achievement? Public health advocacy and investment to eliminate food deserts?
